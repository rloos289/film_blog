I Didn’t like Coco 



A few things I’d like to get out of the way here first. I adore Pixar. I saw Toy Story at age six and Toy Story 3 came out the summer I left for college. That, alongside their consistently excellent output means that Pixar is as much part of my movie bones as things like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Also, it was without a doubt cool to see a movie wrapped in an aesthetic and culture that we don’t see very often and is underrepresented in American culture. Finally, I want to emphasize the title again “I didn’t like Coco,” that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t like it or that I think you’re wrong for liking it. All that being said… 



Okay so I’m messing with structure a bit here but there is one other important thing you should know about my perspective, and thats that I have a complicated relationship with my extended family. So when a movie’s core theme and message comes down to some variation on ‘the importance of family’ it usually rings pretty hollow for me. Not only that but, its also a pretty boring and safe theme that absolutely litters pop culture. Its not a new idea, its not at all revolutionary, its not challenging. Its practically a given of our society. Damn right I’m holding Pixar to a really high standard. Inside Out’s thesis was that sadness is an important emotion without which happiness is impossible. The Toy Story trilogy wrestles with the difficulties and the inevitabilities of change and the unceasing march of time. Wall-E explored the dangerous relationship mankind has with technology and the reciprocal lack-thereof with nature. These are all interesting and rich ideas that are well-explored within their own films, and this kind of thematic depth is more often the rule for Pixar than the exception. 



That thematic issue is probably why I didn’t feel enveloped by the Pixar magic like I usually do. Without the magic I found myself picking apart the movie as I was watching it. Its hard to describe, but throughout the whole thing it felt like I could see the gears of the movie turning. I saw the setups and the ‘this will matter later’ signposting. I wondered if I had just seen too many Pixar movies and they were starting to feel tired and samey like the Marvel films tend to. Now I will admit that I didn’t see the twist coming, but I think that might have been willful ignorance on my part. I distinctly remember thinking about 15 minutes before that reveal that ‘wow, this movie still doesn’t have an actual villain, thats really neat.’ Writing a story devoid of a villain is tough but can really lead to some interesting ideas because it means your hero, rather than struggling against a unique individual, is struggling against a force of nature, or a fact of life, or an inevitability, and those kinds of struggles are rich with depth because they’re often so universal (again, see Inside Out). 

 

Once the story has its actual villain, Miguel’s quest awkwardly jerks from a journey of self-discovery to a by-the-numbers beat the bad guy scenario, a story move which ultimately ruins his character arc. See, Miguel loves music but his family forbids it. Miguel wants to play music more than anything but also wants to be part of his family. BAM, we have an internal conflict for the hero to figure out over the course of the story. But making Ernesto De La Cruz into a murderous jerk erases that internal conflict and Miguel pretty quickly caves to the idea of family being more important than music, but then also his family has a change of heart and Miguel gets to have both without learning anything or changing, so what was the point? 



Apparently I’m the only one who is bothered by all this. Coco currently enjoys a 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and I’ve seen plenty of Facebook statuses gushing about it. Even all of my usual go-to reviewers (from whom I’ve learned a lot of my own critical style from) gave it a glowing praise. Meanwhile, I left the theater feeling like I had seen a mid-tier movie from a top-tier studio.
