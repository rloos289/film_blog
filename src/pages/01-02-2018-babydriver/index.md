Post #2 in my movie series, another favorite of the year. Baby Driver.

When I left this movie I was pretty sure I had just seen a new all-time favorite, and after multiple re-watches and analyses I can confidently say that instinct was correct. This pretty simple story is elevated to greatness by sheer technical mastery. The writing is excellent and hilarious, all the characters are distinct and communicated through actions, there are a bunch of awesome little chekhov’s guns sprinkled throughout, and every scene feels necessary and keeps the story moving. You could probably remove all the dialogue of this movie and still have a solid idea of what its about, and that is high praise in a visual medium. Simultaneously the movie has this unique sense of heightened unreality to it where it clearly knows its a movie, but rather than being snarky and winking at the audience it just uses it to make the world bright and vibrant. Real-world laundromats don’t have perfect repeating patterns of clothes in them, real world people don’t dress by a color-code, and the real world isn’t as unironically steeped in icons of Americana. Baby Driver does all of those things and makes them work. Of course the star of the show is the brilliant gimmick of editing the movie to the rhythm of the year’s best soundtrack WHILE also using that concept to explore the main character and his personality. Mix all of that together and you get my favorite movie of 2017.

Heres the first scene of the movie and it exemplifies pretty much everything I just talked about:
