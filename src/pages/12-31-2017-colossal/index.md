Alright so here is my first post following my Movies of 2017 post. First up, one of my favorites of the year, Colossal.

I’ve got a real weakness for stories that take a goofy sci-fi premise and uses it to explore real human issues, so a movie where Ann Hathaway’s drunken antics are inadvertently controlling a Kaiju thats destroying Seoul was pretty much guaranteed to sell me. On a surface level the metaphor seems pretty heavy-handed, the main character’s alcoholism is dangerous and quite literally hurting people beyond just herself. The movie goes deeper than that though by tying it to an exploration of much darker themes. If it sounds like I’m getting vague its because this is an unusual story that takes several unexpected turns and wondering how it will all unfold is one of the movie’s great joys. The fact that Ann Hathaway’s character controls the Kaiju is shown in the trailer and is only one of many reveals in the movie. Its rare that you get something this unpredictable. Now I will admit Colossal was not marketed well and some people were rightfully annoyed at that. It looks like a comedy but in reality its pretty dark and unsettling. Personally, I liked the discomfort because it stuck in my brain and made me reconsider some of my previous perspectives, but I totally understand if it’s not up your alley. To go any further would get too spoilery, just know that if you have any interest in this movie you should absolutely give it a shot.

P.S. The last 15 minutes of the movie are absolute gold, especially the very last shot.
